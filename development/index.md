This page describes various parts of QSimKit from developers view. You should find all
important information about improving MSP430 module or implementing new peripherals.

### QSimKit peripherals

* [Peripherals overview](peripherals_overview)
* C++ Peripherals
	* [SimulationObject class](simulationobject.html)
	* [ScreenObject class](screenobject.html)
	* [Peripheral class](peripheral.html)
* Python peripherals

### QSimKit MCU modules

Every MCU (currently only MSP430) is shared library implementing common interface provided by QSimKit. This subchapter
describes the relationship between this shared library and the rest of QSimKit.
